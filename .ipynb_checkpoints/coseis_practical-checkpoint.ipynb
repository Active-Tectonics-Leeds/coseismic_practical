While you can experiment with the full body of code further (and I encourage you to do so after the course), we are limited in our ability to help you debug any errors you may encounter. Changing just the values indicate should result in no major errors. <br />\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the launch of ERS-1 in 1991, the coseismic displacements of more than 100 earthquakes have been captured by InSAR. These range in size from Magnitude ~5 to Magnitude ~8, and have a variety of different mechanisms. Typically, coseismic interferograms are interpreted by comparing the interferograms with the predictions of elastic dislocation models, in which slip occurs on one or more dislocation (fault) in an elastic half space. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical class, you will examine 3 coseismic interferograms from continental earthquakes in different tectonic settings. For each one, you will try to find a simple, single-fault model that provides a reasonable fit to the observed interferograms, using some simple elastic dislocation modelling code based on the analytical expressions of Okada (1985, 1992).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To improve understanding of how to interpret coseismic interferograms.\n",
    "2. To understand the coseismic displacement fields produced by different types of earthquake.\n",
    "3. To learn how to produce elastic dislocation models of earthquakes\n",
    "4. To gain an appreciation of the uncertainties involved with determining earthquake mechanisms from coseismic InSAR data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Simple synthetics\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin with some simple synethetic models to help you understand how different earthquake mechanisms appear in InSAR."
